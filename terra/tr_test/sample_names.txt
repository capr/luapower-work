List of 2018–19 Super Rugby transfers
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigationJump to search
This is a list of player movements for Super Rugby teams prior to the end of the 2019 Super Rugby season. Departure and arrivals of all players that were included in a Super Rugby squad for 2018 or 2019 are listed here, regardless of when it occurred. Future-dated transfers are only included if confirmed by the player or his agent, his former team or his new team.

In addition to the main squad, teams can also name additional players that train in backup or development squads for the franchises. These players are denoted by (wider training group) for New Zealand teams, or (extended playing squad) for Australian teams.

Notes
2018 players listed are all players that were named in the initial senior squad, or subsequently included in a 23-man match day squad at any game during the season.
(did not play) denotes that a player did not play at all during one of the two seasons due to injury or non-selection. These players are included to indicate they were contracted to the team.
(short-term) denotes that a player wasn't initially contracted, but came in during the season. This could either be a club rugby player coming in as injury cover, or a player whose contract had expired at another team (typically in the northern hemisphere).
Flags are only shown for players moving to or from another country.
Players may play in several positions, but are listed in only one.
