## What is

Bundle is a small framework for bundling together LuaJIT, Lua modules,
Lua/C modules, DynASM/Lua modules, C libraries, and other static assets
(and even directory listings) into a single fat executable. In its default
configuration, it assumes luapower's [toolchain][building] and
[directory layout][get-involved] (meaning that you have to place your own
code in the luapower directory) and it works on Windows, Linux and OSX,
x86 and x64.

## Usage

~~~
 Compile and link together LuaJIT, Lua modules, Lua/C modules, C libraries,
 and other static assets into a single fat executable.

 Tested with MinGW, GCC and Clang on Windows, Linux and OSX respectively.

  -h  --help                         Show this screen

 Passing -- clears the list of args for that option, including implicit args.

 [1] .lua, .c and .dasl are compiled, other files are added as blobs.

 [2] implicit static libs:           luajit
 [3] implicit dynamic libs:
 [4] implicit frameworks:            ApplicationServices

### Examples

~~~
# full bundle: all Lua modules plus all static libraries
mgit bundle -a --all -m --all -M main -o fat.exe

# minimal bundle: two Lua modules, one static lib, one blob
mgit bundle -a sha2 -m 'sha2 media/bmp/bg.bmp' -M main -o lean.exe

# luajit frontend with built-in luasocket support, no main module
mgit bundle -a 'socket_core mime_core' -m 'socket mime ltn12 socket/*.lua' -o luajit.exe

# run the unit tests
mgit bundle-test
~~~

__NOTE:__ Pass `-m --all` before any explicit `-m` arguments!<br>
__NOTE:__ Pass `-a --all` before any explicit `-a` arguments!

__TIP:__ Pass `-vi "FileDescription=..."` to set the process description
that is shown in the Windows task manager.

## How it works

The core of it is a slightly modifed LuaJIT frontend which adds two
additional loaders at the end of the `package.loaders` table, enabling
`require()` to load modules embedded in the executable when they are
not found externally. `ffi.load()` is also modified to return `ffi.C` if
the requested library is not found, allowing embedded C symbols to be used
instead. Assets can be loaded with `bundle.load(filename)` (see below),
subject to the same policy: load the embedded asset if the corresponding
file is not present in the filesystem.

This allows mixed deployments where some modules and assets are bundled
inside the exe and some are left outside, with no changes to the code and no
rebundling needed. External modules always take precedence over embedded ones,
allowing partial upgrades to the original executable without the need for a
rebuild. Finally, one of the modules (embedded or not) can be specified
to run instead of the usual REPL, effectively enabling single-executable
app deployment for pure Lua apps with no glue C code needed.

### Components

#### .mgit/bundle.sh

The bundler script: compiles and links modules to create a fat executable.

> The reason the script is hidden inside the .mgit dir is to allow you to
use the same command `mgit bundle` on all platforms. In particular, mgit
will drive the script using Git bash on Windows, if git is in your PATH.
You can run the script directly without mgit of course but always run it
from the root directory like this: `.mgit/bundle.sh` or move it there.

#### csrc/bundle/luajit.c

The standard LuaJIT frontend, slightly modified to run stuff from `bundle.c`.

#### csrc/bundle/bundle.c

The bundle loader (C part):

  * installs `require()` loaders on startup for loading embedded Lua
  and C modules
  * fills `_G.arg` with the command-line args
  * sets `_G.arg[-1]` to the name of the main script (`-M` option)
  * calls `require'bundle_loader'`, which means bundle_loader itself can be
  upgraded without a rebuild.

#### bundle_loader.lua

The bundle loader (Lua part):

  * sets `package.path` and `package.cpath` to only load modules relative
  to the exe's dir and not look into the current directory.
  * overrides `ffi.load` to return `ffi.C` when a library is not found.
  * loads the main module, if any, per `arg[-1]`
  * falls back to LuaJIT REPL if there's no main module.

One subtle point about `ffi.load` is that if a library was found in a system
path but that library is also bundled, the bundled one will be used instead.
So the search order is:

  1. external shared library in the directory of the executable.
  2. bundled library inside the executable.
  3. external shared library in the system's search path.

#### bundle.lua

Optional module with an API for loading embedded binary files:

----------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
`bundle.canopen(file) -> t|f`             check if a file exists and can be opened
`bundle.load(filename) -> string`         load a file
`bundle.mmap(filename) -> mmap`           memory-map a file
`mmap.data`                               pointer to file data
`mmap.size`                               file size
`mmap:close()`                            close the mmap object
`bundle.fs_open(filename) -> f`           open a file with [fs]
`bundle.fs_dir(dirname) -> d`             open a dir with [fs]
`bundle.appversion -> string`             app version from the `-av` cmdline option
----------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------

__NOTE:__ These functions look in the filesystem _first_ and only if that
fails they use the embedded blobs.


## Search paths

External files are looked for relative to the executable directory,
regardless of the current directory, as follows:

  * shared library dependencies (either link-time or ffi.load-time) are
  searched for in $exedir
  * Lua modules are searched for in $exedir
  * Lua/C modules are searched for in $exedir/clib
  * static assets are searched for in $exedir


## A note on compression

Compressed executables cannot be mmapped, so they have to stay in RAM
fully and always. If the bundled assets are large and compressible,
better results can be acheived by compressing them individually or not
compressing them at all, instead of compressing the entire exe.
Compression also adds up to the exe's loading time.


## LGPL compliance

Some libraries in luapower are LGPL (check the package table on the homepage
to see which). LGPL does not normally allow static linking on closed-source
projects, but because a bundled executable will always load the dynamic
version of a bundled library if one is found in the directory of the exe,
this behavior complies with the requirement of LGPL to provide a way for
the end-user to use the app with a different version of the LGPL library
without requiring you to ship the dynamic version of the library along
with the executable.
